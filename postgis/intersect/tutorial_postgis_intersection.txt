This is the tutorial to develop and run test cases for Intersection query in postgis.

This tutorial is divided into two sections-
1. Creating the test case.
2. Running them on PostGIS to get the query execution time.

Part 1 :

Assumptions/Notes:
1. In this we are assuming that you have running postgres/postgis on your computer and the database has postgis extension.
2. You simply have to run `intersect.sh` and it will ask you size of both layers:
	a. The fisrt layer is the number of rows of horizontal lines you want in the layer.
	b. The second layer is the number of rows of vertical lines  you want in the layer.
3. We are writting all the queries in a single file and execute that file on the sql console and record the time for just within query without any read and write operation.


Flow of data:
1. `misc.txt` contains the queries to drop and recreate the geometry tables in the database.
2. `layer1.py`(`layer1_out.txt`) and `layer2.py`(`layer_out.txt`) will create temp files with the sql queries to store those geometries in the database.
3. The `intersect.sh` also asks whether want to index the datasets or, `1` for yes and `0` otherwise. The index queries are stored in `index.txt`.
4. Finally we have `intersect.py` that will create with sql queries for `intersect` function and store them in `intersect_out.txt`
5. `script.py` stiches them all together and create a intersect.sql which is to be executed in the postgres console.

Part 2:
1. Now that we have intersect.sql file containing all the queries, we will execute the file on the console.
2. On the timing flag by `\timing` command.
3. and run the intersect.sql by command `\i intersect.sql` in the psql console.

There is no write operation on the above queries. To check the query results remove the following comment in `intersect.py` :
`#print '''SELECT * FROM lineLayer WHERE  ''' `

Database connectivity:
	* sudo -u postgres createuser -P  `	USER_NAME`
	* sudo -u postgres createdb -O  `USER_NAME` `DATABASE_NAME` 
	* sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis; CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;" `DATABASE_NAME`
	* psql -h localhost -U `USER_NAME` `DATABASE_NAME`
